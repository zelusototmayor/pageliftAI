# Claude Workflow Rules

1. First, think about the problem, read the codebase to find the relevant files, and write a plan in tasks/todo.md.

2. The plan should have a checklist of tasks that you can mark as completed.

3. Before you start working, get in touch with me and I will review the plan.

4. Then begin working on the tasks, marking them as completed as you go.

5. At every step along the way, just give me a detailed explanation of the changes you made.

6. Make each task and code change as simple as possible. We want to avoid massive or complex modifications. Each change should impact as little of the code as possible. Everything comes down to simplicity.

7. Finally, add a "Review" section to the tasks/todo.md file with a summary of the changes made and any other relevant information.
