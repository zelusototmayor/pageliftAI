# PageLift AI Job 38 Analysis Task

## Plan

This task involves investigating why PageLift AI processing results for job 38 (https://desentopecanalizacoes.pt/) are poor, consisting of empty template sections repeated instead of meaningful content.

### Investigation Approach

- [ ] 1. Connect to the database and retrieve job 38 data
- [ ] 2. Examine the analysis_input (scraped sections) to see what was extracted
- [ ] 3. Examine the analysis_output (AI categorization) to see how it was processed
- [ ] 4. Fetch the original website content to compare with scraped data
- [ ] 5. Identify specific failure points in the pipeline by analyzing:
  - Section extraction logic in scrape.py
  - Content cleaning and analysis logic in analyze.py  
  - Token limits and chunking behavior
  - AI model responses and parsing
- [ ] 6. Document findings and root causes

### Technical Details

**Database Schema:**
- Job table has `analysis_input` (JSON of parsed sections) and `analysis_output` (JSON of AI-categorized sections)
- Database URL: postgresql://postgres:postgres@db:5432/pagelift

**Key Files to Examine:**
- `/Users/zelu/Desktop/code/PageLift AI/app/services/scrape.py` - Section extraction
- `/Users/zelu/Desktop/code/PageLift AI/app/services/analyze.py` - AI analysis and categorization
- `/Users/zelu/Desktop/code/PageLift AI/app/models.py` - Database schema
- `/Users/zelu/Desktop/code/PageLift AI/app/api/routes.py` - Database access

**Expected Failure Points:**
1. Section extraction missing meaningful content
2. Content cleaning removing too much text
3. AI analysis producing generic/empty responses
4. Token limits causing truncation
5. Parsing failures in OpenAI response handling
